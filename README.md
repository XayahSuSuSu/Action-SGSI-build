## Quick start

1. Fork this warehouse
   
   When you use it for the first time, you need to **Fork this warehouse**, and then configure the parameters

2. Configuration parameters

   Assuming that you have already Fork this warehouse and entered your own warehouse at this time, click Actions in the menu-SGSI_Build under All workflows in the left column-Run workflow gray button on the right-fill in the corresponding parameters

   |Description |Name |Value (fill in according to your own needs) |
   |:------: |:------: | :------------------------: |
   |Link to package to be made |ROM_URL |https://hugeota.d.miui.com/21.5.31/miui_TUCANA_21.5.31_cb42ec9bed_11.0.zip|
   |Package name to be made |ZIP_NAME |miui_TUCANA_21.5.31_cb42ec9bed_11.0.zip |
   |Type of package to be made |OS_TYPE |miui |
   |Package name |REPACK_NAME|SGSI.zip |

3. Start production
   
   Click the Run workflow green button to start production

## Personalized configuration

1. Customize and streamline functions
   
   Modify the simplified script of the corresponding system in the apps_clean folder, please refer to the modification by yourself

## Next steps

Due to the limitation of [Github large binaries](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/working-with-large-files/distributing-large-binaries), if the SGSI after production exceeds* *2GB** then **cannot upload**, so this Action will automatically select **Direct upload**/**Sub-volume upload** according to the size of the SGSI after production.

If uploading in sub-volumes, please download each sub-volume and manually unzip it

```
cat ${fileName}*>${fileName}.tar.gz    # merge the sub-volume file fileName*
tar xzvf ${fileName}.tar.gz            # Unzip
```
